## All resonant asteroids for Jupiter and Saturn
Folder `libration_asteroids_JS` contains all pure resonant asteroids for
JUPITER and Saturn. Every file contains asteroids are related to one resonance.
Integers of resonance pointed in name of file. If you have access to database
consists of data from this
[project](https://github.com/4xxi/resonances-database) you can use script
get_JS_resonant_asteroids.sh for building your own files.
